## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Before Publishing:

- ✅ Double-check the ZIP file works (test it yourself)
- ✅ Verify all documentation is accurate
- ✅ Make sure legal disclaimers are prominent
- ✅ Test the extension in Chrome one more time

### Legal Considerations:

Your release includes multiple warnings about:
- LinkedIn Terms of Service violations
- Potential account bans
- Legal risks
- "Educational purposes only" disclaimer

**This is crucial** to protect yourself legally.

### User Expectations:

Set clear expectations:
- ⚠️ This is NOT on Chrome Web Store
- ⚠️ Users must install via Developer Mode
- ⚠️ Extension may be disabled after Chrome updates
- ⚠️ Use at own risk

---

## 📊 Distribution Strategy

### Option 1: GitHub Only
- Keep it simple
- Users download from Releases page
- Low maintenance

### Option 2: GitHub + Marketing
- Create demo video (YouTube)
- Write blog post about technical implementation
- Share on Reddit (r/programming, r/datascience)
- Post on LinkedIn (ironically)
- Add to portfolio website

### Option 3: Private Distribution
- Share link only with friends/trusted users
- Don't promote publicly
- Reduce legal risk

**Recommended: Option 1** (safest, simplest)
