## Tips for Success

### Good Release Practices:
- ‚úÖ Use semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v2.0.0)
- ‚úÖ Write clear, detailed release notes
- ‚úÖ Include screenshots or demo videos
- ‚úÖ List all breaking changes prominently
- ‚úÖ Thank contributors (if any)
- ‚úÖ Link to documentation

### What to Include in Release Notes:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes
- Known issues
- Installation instructions
- Legal disclaimers

### Versioning Guide:
- **Major (v2.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major rewrites
- **Minor (v1.1.0)**: New features, no breaking changes
- **Patch (v1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, small improvements

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't create tag v1.0.0, already exists"**
- Use a different version number (v1.0.1, v1.1.0, etc.)
- Or delete the existing tag (not recommended for published releases)

**ZIP file won't upload**
- Check file size (GitHub has limits)
- Make sure it's a valid ZIP file
- Try compressing again

**Release not appearing**
- Make sure you clicked "Publish release" (not "Save draft")
- Check that you're on the Releases page
- Refresh the page
